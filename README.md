# cat_vs_dog_classification

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately distinguishing between images of cats and dogs. The project will utilize a dataset containing images of both animals for training and evaluation. Various machine learning algorithms, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), will be explored to identify the most effective model. Challenges such as overfitting, variations in image quality, and generalization to unseen data will be addressed. The outcome of the project is expected to be a robust model capable of accurately classifying new images as either cats or dogs, with potential applications in pet recognition technology or animal welfare. The tools and technologies used will include Python, TensorFlow , Scikit-learn, and image processing libraries like OpenCV.
